Since learning Sass I noticed it makes everything so much simpler. 


I really like varibles because it makes the whole process of css much easier, instead of endless search in the script if you made one change, it can be very time consuming to go over the whole script to fix everything. So deciding in the beginning what you are going to use and add it to your script where it suppose to be is really nice. and if you change your mind you just have to change it in one place. 

Nesting is something I wish I knew in the two projects before this one. It helps a lot since my scripts have been all over the place and using nesting makes everything so clean and more understandable. 

@extend Is another thing in Sass that I really like. it helps when you are styling many things in the same way but you want to change little things about it like the color of the font or something like that but keep all the other settings. 

Sass partials is something I really enjoy, that I can just make my own color pallette in another file and choose from that. Im sure I will use this a lot. This will make everything work faster for me and have a nice color pallette. 

@import option makes everything really clean in the script, and it makes it really organized. 

Mixin and all of the above really do make everything easy, this will help a lot for the upcoming projects, its pretty nice to be able to add a rule that u will use often an add it into mixin and then add it wherever you want instead of always writing the same thing over and over again. .
